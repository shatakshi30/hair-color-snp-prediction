# Hair Color Prediction from SNP Data

This project explores the use of informative **single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** for predicting human **hair color phenotypes**. We applied **dimensionality reduction (PCA)**, **clustering**, and **machine learning models** on SNP genotype data using three different panels/tools: **HIrisPlex**, **HIrisPlexS**, and **Snipper**.

## üìä Datasets

- Total SNPs: **283 SNPs**
- Source: **OpenSNP database**  
- Genotype data includes SNPs known to be associated with pigmentation traits.

## Objectives

- To identify the most informative SNPs for **hair color** prediction.
- To compare the performance of different SNP panels:
  - **HIrisPlex**
  - **HIrisPlexS**
  - **Snipper**
- To evaluate how **PCA** and **clustering** reflect phenotype separability.
- To build **predictive models**:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Random Forest (RF)**

## Methods

### Tools & Workflow:

- **PCA Analysis**:
  - Dimensionality reduction to visualize SNP variance.
  - Identification of top-contributing SNPs per principal component.

- **Clustering**:
  - Unsupervised clustering to group individuals by genotype profiles.

- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Built and compared **SVM**, **KNN**, and **Random Forest** models.
  - Performed **hyperparameter tuning** and cross-validation.

### SNP Panels Analyzed:

- **Snipper**
- **HIrisPlex**
- **HIrisPlexS**

## Results

### PCA & Clustering:

- PCA revealed **clear separation** for certain **hair colors**.
- Identified **top-contributing SNPs** for each panel.
- Clustering aligned with **known hair color groups**.

### Predictive Models:

| Model          | Performance Summary |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **SVM**        | Best for complex patterns, good accuracy |
| **KNN**        | Simpler but effective for highly separated classes |
| **Random Forest** | Performed well, provided feature importance insights |

### Key Finding:

- **HIrisPlexS** gave the best performance for **hair color** prediction.
- Certain **common SNPs** across all panels were consistently top contributors.
